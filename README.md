### Course Materials for TTSM Workshop I: Symbolic Music Data Processing and Generation

[Technology & Thought in Sonic Media (TTSM)](https://ttsm.link) - is a series of FREE live online workshops by Ph.D. students and candidates on topics of Music Technology and Sound Studies. Academic knowledge is represented in a short and effective format. This Summer tutors from the Music Department of the University of California San Diego (UCSD) share insides and skills related to their research. Music Generation, Neural Networks and AI, Sound Synthesis, Jazz and Social Research, Conceptual Worldmaking, Epistemology of Electronic Music Instruments, etc.. these can be the tags for this year's TTSM Summer School.

I am the instructor for the first [two-day workshop](https://ttsm.link/more#musicdata). On the first day, I introduced how to process a typical MIDI file in Python. [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/Jovie-Liu/TTSM_Workshop_Symbolic_Music_Generation/blob/main/MIDI_Data_Processing_Tutorial1.ipynb) covers the structure and meaning of MIDI metadata and how to extract musical information from it. The processed data could be used in various tasks such as algorithmic composition, statistical corpus analysis, and our second neural network music generation workshop.

Based on the data processing techniques we developed on the first day, on the second day, we used the processed data to train a neural network for music generation. As our input is processed as sequential monophonic pieces, the most suitable neural network model would be an autoregressive model, such as RNN. [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/Jovie-Liu/TTSM_Workshop_Symbolic_Music_Generation/blob/main/RNN_Training_Tutorial2.ipynb) introduced how to build one's own RNN model by writing the formulas and functions from scratch, instead of applying a pre-built library. This exercise gives students a deeper understanding of the mechanism of neural networks, and also demonstrates how to flexibly design and train neural networks rather than being constrained by the settings of other programmers.
